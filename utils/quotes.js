        text: `Have ever you heard of the Land of Beyond, That dreams at the gates of the day? Alluring it lies at the skirts of the skies, And ever so far away; Alluring it calls: O ye the yoke galls, And ye of the trail overfond, With saddle and pack, by paddle and track, Let's go to the Land of Beyond! 
        
        Have ever you stood where the silences brood, And vast the horizons begin, At the dawn of the day to behold far away The goal you would strive for and win? Yet ah! in the night when you gain to the height, With the vast pool of heaven star-spawned, Afar and agleam, like a valley of dream, Still mocks you a Land of Beyond.
        
        Thank God! there is always a Land of Beyond For us who are true to the trail; A vision to seek, a beckoning peak, A farness that never will fail; A pride in our soul that mocks at a goal, A manhood that irks at a bond, And try how we will, unattainable still, Behold it, our Land of Beyond!`,

        text: `Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood, And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;

        Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim,
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same,

        And both that morning equally lay, In leaves no step had trodden black.
        Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
        I doubted if I should ever come back.

        I shall be telling this with a sigh, Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”, I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference.`,
