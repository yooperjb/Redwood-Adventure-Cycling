<h2>
    2024 Adventure Series Sponsors
</h2>

<section class="opener">
    <p>
        This Adventure Series is free to participate, but it's definitely not free to run. It takes a lot time and money
        to build the site, curate routes, approve rides, pay for web hosting space, etc. Most of this comes straight out
        of our pockets because it's a passion project we care about. So, if it wasn't for the folks listed on this page,
        this series would be a lot less exciting. Of course we don't need "prizes" to get on our bike, but it sure does
        sweeten the deal. Please support these amazing companies listed below, and thank them for their generous contributions.

            Bell Helmets has again graciously offered to contribute helmets for the Adventure Series for 2024. We all know our helmets are
            probably a little older than they should be, so go adventure and you could be the lucky winner of a brand
            spankin' new <a href="https://www.bellhelmets.com/bike/" target="_blank">Bell Helmet</a> worth up to $250.

            We all know how much Adventure's Edge gives to this community, and they've been generous enough to extend

Show some love back and visit Adventure's Edge in both <a href="https://www.adventuresedge.com/" target="_blank">Arcata</a> and <a href="https://www.adventuresedge.com/" target="_blank">Eureka</a>.

            It's rare not to see Revo's name on a local cycling event, and this series isn't any different. They've happily
            donated to the cause again in 2024 with some superior swag. Check them out in Henderson Center <a href="https://www.revolutionbicycle.com/" target="_blank">Eureka</a> and Northtown <a href="https://www.revolutionbicycle.com/" target="_blank">Arcata</a> for great biking gear to supply your adventures. Be sure to tell them RAC sent you!
