    <h4>What Are the Routes?</h4>
    <p>For 2024 we are focusing on getting out there. While a few of these routes are right under your noses, the others
        are in areas you may have never explored and will require a bit of travel. Each of the rides are in great spots to spend the day, or weekend. Take multiple bikes and get a few rides in at other spots nearby. The goal is to get folks out to areas that see much less traffic than the classic routes, but are well worth the adventure (in our opinion). Most of the routes will start and end at the same location to make logistics easier. Although loops are great, we decided to add more out-and-back routes this year in order to utilize these great roads. Because we love all types of cycling, the routes will cover a range of terrain - from road rides, gravel roads, to single-track mountain bike trails - the route descriptions will guide bike choice. To see the selected routes in detail, please visit the <a href="/bikeroutes">Routes page</a>.</p>
