    <h4>
        Rules of the Peloton
    </h4>
    <p>
        To complete a segment, you may start and finish your ride anywhere, as long as your ride includes the designated
        Strava segment. Keep in mind that Strava segments are directional, so you must ride in the correct direction for
        it to count.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you’re certain you rode the segment but don’t see it in your completed list, don’t worry. We know GPS signals
        and Strava segments can be finicky at times. As long as you completed the segment, and we verify it you’ll
        receive credit.
        Sometimes, Strava may hide a segment from your list—check out <a
            href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918187-Segment-Matching-Issues" target="_blank">this
            information</a> for troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a ride-at-your-own-risk adventure series. By logging in and submitting a ride, you acknowledge and
        accept full responsibility for your own safety. Please follow all traffic laws, ride safely, and—most
        importantly—have fun!
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this is a cycling adventure series, all rides must be completed on a bicycle. To keep things fair,
        e-bikes are not allowed. However, if there is enough interest, we may consider an e-bike category in the
        future.

    <h4>
        Record Keeping
    </h4>
    <p>
        After completing a segment, submit your ride through your Dashboard for verification (you must be logged
        in). Follow the instructions on the "Submit Your Ride" form. Since points are determined by your ride, only ONE
        segment can be submitted for each ride.
    </p>
    <p>
        To simplify ride submission, select a recent Strava ride from the dropdown list. Important: only your last
        five Strava activities will be available for selection. If you need to submit an older ride, please <a
            href="mailto:info@redwoodadventurecycling.com">contact us</a>, and we’ll do our best to accommodate.
    </p>
    <p>
        All rides must be verified through submitted Strava rides—no exceptions. Your rides must be set to public in
        Strava to be verified. Once submitted, your rides will appear in your Dashboard, and verified rides will count
        toward the leaderboard. We encourage all riders to join the <a
            href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/redwoodadventurecycling" target="_blank">RAC Strava Club</a> to connect
        with others and track each other's progress!

{{!-- Route Scoring --}}
<article>
    <h4>
        Ride Difficulty & Scoring
    </h4>
    <p>
        Ride difficulty is subjective, so we use a straightforward method to calculate points. Based on experience, a
        typical ride for fit cyclists in Humboldt County includes 1,000 feet of elevation per 10 miles, or 100
        feet per mile. While this is higher than in many regions, it's a reasonable baseline for scoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Total ride points are determined by mileage and elevation gain. While factors like road surface, climb
        placement, and wind conditions also affect difficulty, these are harder to quantify. The tables below outline
        the scoring system. These are intended as a general guide—some may find routes easier or harder than their
        assigned rating.
