VALUES

('41550273', 2023, 'Coastal Trail Loop', 12.7, 1150, 30, 'Easy','This is a shorter fun loop that travels along a section of the Coastal Trail from Prairie Creek State Park. Check out Radar Station B-71 along the way.'),

('41550287',2023,'Grasshopper Lookout Loop', 16.2, 3515, 50,'Very Difficult','This a gnarly ride up to the Grasshopper Fire Lookout with almost two miles with grades over 20%! Mountain bike gearing is highly recommended. The views on top are worth it, with a fun ride down the Hanson Ridge MUT, albeit a little more climbing.'),

('41552966',2023,'Lassic Loop',29.8,3600, 50,'Difficult','Great loop in a rarely used area in the Mount Lassic Wilderness. I would recommend riding the loop counter-clockwise, taking the nice, steady grade up to the Lassic Peaks. If you have time, the hike out to Signal Peak is short and has excellent views of the area.'),

('41550294',2023,'Little Bald Hills Loop',17.3,2200, 40,'Difficult','Great mountain bike loop starting and ending in Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park. The ride starts off with a five mile climb which can be pretty steep in some sections, but the views are well worth it. The trail descends down to the Paradise Trail just above South Fork Road. Ride South Fork Rd. eight miles back to the trailhead.'),

('41552773',2023,'Look Prairie - Peavine Loop',13.1,2700,65,'Difficult','This is a fun, non-technical mountain bike loop with a steep initial climb up the Look Prairie MUT. The climb is about found miles long with some steep sections better than 20%. It traverses Peavine Ridge along the Peavine MUT, then descends down the Thorton MUT through Albee Campground.'),

('41550317',2023,'Lostaggon',41.2,4340,55,'Difficult',"This route is a link up of the Lost Man Creek Trail and the Ossagon Trails in Redwood National Park. There are a few good places to start/end this route depending on which section you want to ride first. A good place to start is the Lost Man Creek Trailhead off 101 north of Bald Hills Rd. The climb up to Lady Bird Johnson Grove is paved and steep! Lost Man Creek is an old decommissioned road which mostly trends downhill, but also has some steep climbs.The Ossagon Trail hasn't seen much maintenance in the last few years so can be pretty rough in spots. Prepare to get wet at the bottom."),

('41552498',2023,'Paradise Royale/ Pacific Rim',22.2,3150, 55,'Difficult',"This route combines both the Pacific Rim and Paradise Royale trails into a loop. There are many ways to complete this route. A great start/end location is the Low Gap TH, ride the Pacific Rim in a counter-clockwise direction, and then Paradise Royale clockwise. Pacific Rim is much different riding than Paradise, which apparently uses a historic trading trail. From the lower parking area off of Shelter Cove Rd. you'll climb switchbacks to the top ridge-line through beautiful Oaks and Madrones. Enjoy the incredible views at the top before descending on loose, chunky terrain to the Parasdise Trail."),

('41552660',2023,'Ship Mountain - French Hill Loop',45,7350, 75,'Very Difficult','Incredible gravel loop ride in the Smith River Recreation area with the option to visit two fire lookouts in one ride! There is a tough ten mile, 4,500 feet climb with some steep grades over 20% up to Ship Mountain Lookout, but the views are worth it! Depending on the time of the year, there may be a lookout at Ship Mountain - sign the guest book! Take a side trip to Bear Basin Lookout if you have time.
Enjoy the descent down the newly repaired Bear Basin Rd. before another brutal 4 mile climb with some pitches over 25%. Take in the 360 degree views on Gordon Mountain Ridge, before a long, loose descent back to the campground.'),

('41552569',2023,'Showers Pass Loop',75.4, 11500, 75,'Epic',"A quintessential Humboldt County adventure ride, this ride is epic. With over 12 thousand feet of climbing on mostly gravel roads, be prepared for a long day. Take plenty of food and water, and a camera for all the amazing views - you'll see more cattle than cars. There are a couple creeks for filtering water if needed. The route starts/ends at Three Corners and climbs up Kneeland or Greenwood Heights. Recommended direction is clockwise from the airport.");
